                A plane angle is an area in contact of two rectangles that cross each other in a plane
               <!-- FSF: to be completed -->
                Rectilinear angles are equal.
                A line is the path of a point.
                A line is a length established by the flow of a point.

                A line is a length from ... <!-- FSF: to be competed -->
                An established line is the space by which we measure the movement of a point.
                A line is the way of a point.
                A A line is the space that a movable point marks.
                A line is the space between two points.
                An area is the space between two lines. 
                A (geometric) body is the space between two areas.
                D A straight line is the shortest space between two and the same points.
                B An area is the space that a line establishes by its movement (not accomplished by a lateral movement) <!-- FSF: to be checked -->
                C A body is the space that an area produces from its movement to one side.
