             <translation> 
                 None of the outstanding men in Livy is more remarkable or noble than Camillus Furius, who was 
                 both an extraordinary man and an outstanding leader of his age. Whether it is his military 
                 expertise, his mental and physical strength, his outstanding diligence and excellence in his 
                 accomplishments, or the very high esteem in which he was held by all, it seems his good fortune in everything 
                 should be considered his most desired quality. Before Camillus Furius there were few 
                 outstanding Romans. Yet, what a tremendous crop of the most courageous men and leaders - the most 
                 illustrious in the whole world - came from this wonderful leader, as if from a unique seedbed 
                 of that vigorous, superbly powerful Roman excellence! What David was for the Jews, Cyrus for the
                 Persians, Hector for the Trojans, Achilles for the Greeks, Epaminondas for the Thebans, Alexander 
                 for the Macedonians - all incomparable and invincible Leaders – that is Camillus for the Romans, 
                 the most powerful commander of his time, and a remarkable example to the many and strong Romans 
                 who came after him (as Livy has superbly and thoroughly shown). That this republic flourished to 
                 such a great degree and ended up ruling the world was possible, I would suggest, not because of 
                 the political institution of the republic - which was certainly not the best one for ruling or
                 governing - but because of several exceptional and brilliant men - especially senators and 
                 magistrates - extremely skillful, some of them in law, others in arms, and burning with the 
                 perpetual desire to emulate the most honourable deeds, both at home and abroad. They attempted 
                 with serious deliberation and care whatever would most serve Roman excellence and dignity. 
                 Fortune responded to Virtue and how great a harvest came from these vigorous, tremendous deeds,
                 and what great fame, public as well as private! It follows that the particular greatness of the 
                 flourishing republic and its powerful rule was not so much a product of the public form of 
                 government, as of the insight and virtue of its public men. Pay attention, therefore, to the 
                 exploits of particularly remarkable men, their outstanding deeds, records, whatever impressive 
                 feat in the state or on the field is extant. And one must note carefully the things that are most
                 appropriate for prevailing in a monarchy, and apply them scrupulously to one's own purpose. The 
                 aristocratic and democratic actions should be valued according to the esteem they merit in a 
                 monarchy, without detriment to the authority of royal majesty, which is not to be harmed or 
                 prejudiced in any way. For, in a principate, popular sentiments, like philosophical 
                 dispositions and all fanciful desires, should be moderated. The qualities of subjects should 
                 be bent to the position of the prince, no matter how pre-eminent they are. And the private 
                 matters of the people or aristocracy should not intrude upon the actions or plans of kings. In 
                 this respect most royal counsels, magistrates and ministers err. For they do not know how to 
                 distinguish skillfully and solidly between the particular situations of republics, and their 
                 own policies. This has caused thousands of mistakes in public counsel and action. In histories
                 the words and deeds of those considered the wisest, bravest and most righteous of their time are
                 praised. But it makes a big difference what kind of politician is speaking or doing something, and
                 to what purpose, and in what sort of republic, and in what particular instance. Everyone acts in 
                 the interests of his own situation, whether public of private, and no-one binds his own hands. In 
                 the Roman republic many things were said and done most prudently, which would be absurd, if they were 
                 expressed in a kingdom and in this age. Without judgment one does not know anything. Whatever is 
                 praiseworthy is fit for purpose.
