            <translation>Note in this revolution, that for individual years, he added the place of the sun in the nativity, as much as the Sun is moved in one natural day, and he order that 
            time of the revolution to himself, that with the place of the Sun coming together thus was discovered. As how in November the Sun is moved into Scorpio, he established this revolution
            in the month November, when he nevertheless was born in September: and on which [tenth] day, and on which hour and minute, &amp; in such place the Sun is about to be, he describes and produces a figure for this time.
            And of this reversion, which may be an indication, see in Johannes Schoner, book three, folio 204, that is chapter 12. We can even treat the remaining planets in the same manner, and
            deduce the more fickle ones in more slowly things: and certainly, these things come togheter optimally. But he might be able that this doubt is moved whether they grasp the ordinary movement of the Sun [and]
            whether in truth even daily in the time of the nativity. And here it seems that the same things have been stated in writing.
