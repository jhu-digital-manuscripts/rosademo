          <p>ii+195+ii. Bound in quarternios, Remnants of signatures in lower left of some
                  quires, at times partially trimmed away, e.g. fol. <locus>9r</locus>; most are
                  barely visible in the gutter. These signatures are modern Arabic numerals in
                  pencil, and were perhaps added when the book was rebound. Catchwords throughout,
                  lower right side. Leaves numbered in ink at an early date on the top right corner
                  of rectos. Foliation begins with number 1 on fol. <locus>2r</locus>. A later hand
                  has added pagination in modern pencil (also labeling <locus>2r</locus> as fol. 1)
                  that attempts to correct gaps in the earlier foliation, which result from loss of
                  leaves, by assigning dual page numbers at <locus from="38" to="39">38/39</locus>,
                     <locus from="70" to="71">70/71</locus>, <locus from="138" to="139">138/139</locus>, <locus from="148" to="149">148/149</locus>/ <locus from="158" to="159">158/159</locus>, and 180/181. In this description, pages are numbered
                  sequentially beginning with fol. 1r, as indicated in the collation.</p>

        <note rend="LAYOUT">
          <p>Some quires ruled in brown crayon, some in lead. A few prickings survive along the
                  bottoms of folios, e.g. throughout quire XXI. Two ruling patterns appear
                  throughout the manuscript. The first is ruled in brown crayon and has six vertical
                  and two horizontal through lines. In these, the text block is divided into two
                  columns, with both edges of the column delineated by vertical lines. In addition,
                  each column has one vertical line to separate the first letter from the rest of
                  the line. Horizontal through lines define the top and bottom of the text block,
                  with 28-30 lines per column. The second pattern is ruled in lead with eight rather
                  than six vertical lines, and with 27-28 lines per column. In this pattern,
                  vertical through lines delineate each column and two additional vertical lines,
                  which do not extend much beyond the text block, separate initial letters from the
                  rest of the line. The ruling patterns are associated with the two scribes
                  responsible for the work, with the brown crayon and six vertical lines usually,
                  although not invariably, present during scribe one’s stints, and the lead ruling
                  and eight vertical lines corresponding to the work of scribe two. See, e.g., the
                  outer bifolium of quire two, which is ruled in brown, and the inner bifolia, which
                  are ruled in lead (cf. section 6 below). Note that the last ruled line is not
                  always used, e.g. <locus>88v</locus> and <locus>89r</locus>. Text blocks vary
                  slightly in size; approximately 205 x150 mm. Each column approximately 70 mm wide.</p>
        </note>
        <note rend="SCRIPT">
          <p>Two scribes. Scribe one completed the first quire and the outer bifolium, recto
                  and verso (i.e. fols. <locus>9</locus> and <locus>16</locus>), of the second
                  quire. Scribe two is responsible for fols. <locus>10r</locus> through
                  <locus>15v</locus> and fol. <locus>17r</locus> through part of <locus>87v</locus>.
                  From there to the end we once again see the work of scribe one. Both scribes use a
                  cursiva formata script. Corrections are sparse, but some examples of lining
                  through, erasure, and addition exist; see, e.g. fols. <locus>2v</locus> and
                     <locus>3r</locus>. Mostly brown ink throughout, with some black stints.</p>

        <note rend="DECORATION">
          <p>Numerous rubrics accompany miniatures and identify speakers. Four-line initial on
                     <locus>1r</locus> featuring blue letter with white penwork. Letter encloses
                  gold leaf and blue, red, and white decorative vines, and is boxed in red with
                  white penwork and enclosed in a gold border. Numerous two-line gold initials
                  throughout with blue and red ornamentation and decorative white penwork. Red,
                  blue, and gold border with decorative white penwork on <locus>1r</locus> only.
                  Vines and flowers in the same color scheme extend from the border to fill the
                  margins and are accompanied by green leaf designs. Two dragons are at the top
                  center of the border. 59 grisaille miniatures.</p>

Title appears in second compartment of spine. Other compartments feature flowers tooled in the center and additional toolwork surrounding. Double fillets on top, fore, and bottom edges. Roll with flower design on front and back turn-ins. Title, second compartment of spine in gold-tooled letters: “ROMAN / DE / LA ROSE”. Marbled endpapers, front and back.
