     *   <li>All images are in normal/reading order.</li>
     *   <li>Front cover will be the first image, if it exists.</li>
     *   <li>If there is a front cover, it will always be followed by a front matter pastedown.</li>
     *   <li>Misc images are last to appear in the image list, if at all.</li>
     *   <li>If a back cover exists, it will always be proceeded by an end matter pastedown.</li>

     * For example, if image one in the original naming scheme is a misc image of a color bar and
     * image two in the original naming scheme is an image of the spine, and the rest of
     * the images fit the above conditions, the first two images can be manually moved to
     * a temp location, outside of the book location. The tool can then be run on the remaining
     * images in the book. After the file map is generated, it can be manually edited to
