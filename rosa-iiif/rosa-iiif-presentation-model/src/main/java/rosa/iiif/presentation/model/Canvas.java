/**
 * The canvas represents an individual page or view and acts as a central point for
 * laying out the different content resources that make up the display. Canvases must
 * be identified by a URI and it must be an HTTP(s) URI. If following the recommended
 * URI pattern, the {name} parameter must uniquely distinguish the canvas from all
 * other canvases in the object. As with sequences, the name should not begin with a
 * number. Suggested patterns are “f1r” or “p1”.
 *
 * Every canvas must have a label to display, and a height and a width as integers. A
 * canvas is a two-dimensional rectangular space with an aspect ratio that represents
 * a single logical view of some part of the object, and the aspect ratio is given with
 * the height and width properties. This allows resources to be associated with specific
 * parts of the canvas, rather than the entire space. Content must not be associated
 * with space outside of the canvas’s dimensions, such as at coordinates below 0,0 or
 * greater than the height or width.
 *
 * It is recommended that if there is (at the time of implementation) a single image that
 * depicts the page, then the dimensions of the image are used as the dimensions of the
 * canvas for simplicity. If there are multiple full images, then the dimensions of the
 * largest image should be used. If the largest image’s dimensions are less than 1200
 * pixels on either edge, then the canvas’s dimensions should be double that of the image.
 * Clients must be aware that this is not always the case, such as in the examples presented,
 * and instead must always scale images into the space represented by the canvas. The
 * dimensions of the canvas should be the same scale as the physical object, and thus images
 * should depict only the object. This can be accomplished by cropping the image, or
 * associating only a segment of the image with the canvas. The physical dimensions of the
 * object may be available via a service, either embedded within the description or requiring
 * an HTTP request to retrieve them.
 *
 * Image resources, and only image resources, are included in the images property of the canvas.
 * These are linked to the canvas via annotations. Other content, such as transcriptions, video,
 * audio or commentary, is provided via external annotation lists referenced in the otherContent
 * property. The value of both of these properties must be a list, even if there is only one
 * entry. Both are optional, as there may be no additional information associated with the canvas.
 * Note that the items in the otherContent list may be either objects with an @id property or
 * strings. In the case of a string, this is the URI of the annotation list and the type of
 * “sc:AnnotationList” can be inferred.
 *
 * In a sequence with the viewingHint value of “paged” and presented in a book viewing user
 * interface, the first canvas should be presented by itself – it is typically either the cover
 * or first recto page. Thereafter, the canvases represent the sides of the leaves, and hence
 * may be presented with two canvases displayed as an opening of the book. If there are canvases
 * which are in the sequence but would break this ordering, then they must have the viewingHint
 * property with a value of “non-paged”. Similarly if the first canvas is not a single up, it
 * must be marked as “non-paged” or an empty canvas added before it.
 *
 * Canvases may be dereferenced separately from the manifest via their URIs, and the following
 * representation information should be returned. This information should be embedded within the
 * sequence, as per previously.
